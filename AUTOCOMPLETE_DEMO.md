# Auto-Complete Interests Editor Demo

## What's New

The interests editor now features a smart auto-complete dropdown that appears as users type in the search box. Here's how it works:

### Features

1. **Real-time Search**: As you type, matching interests appear instantly in a dropdown
2. **Smart Sorting**: Results are sorted by relevance:
   - Exact matches first
   - Interests starting with your query
   - Interests containing your query
3. **Click to Add**: Simply click on any suggestion to add it to your interests
4. **Custom Interest Fallback**: If no matches found, option to add your typed text as custom interest
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Already selected interests won't appear in suggestions
6. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Escape key to close the dropdown
7. **Click Outside to Close**: Clicking outside the dropdown closes it

### How to Test

1. Open any user's public profile page (your own or others)
2. If you're viewing your own profile, click the "Edit" button next to Interests
3. In the search box, start typing any partial interest name like:
   - "gym" → shows "gym" and related fitness interests
   - "music" → shows "music", "musical", etc.
   - "cook" → shows "cooking" and food-related interests
   - "tech" → shows "technology", "tech", etc.
4. Click on any suggestion to instantly add it to your interests
5. If nothing matches, you'll see an option to add your text as a custom interest

### Technical Implementation

- Uses fuzzy matching across all 117+ predefined interests
- Limits suggestions to 8 items for optimal UX
- Maintains state consistency with existing interest management
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Accessible with proper focus management

### Categories Covered

The autocomplete searches across all 8 interest categories:

- Lifestyle (yoga, meditation, wellness, etc.)
- Sports & Fitness (gym, running, hiking, etc.)
- Music & Arts (music, concerts, art, etc.)
- Food & Dining (cooking, restaurants, wine, etc.)
- Travel (adventure, backpacking, culture, etc.)
- Technology (startups, ai, gaming, etc.)
- Entertainment (movies, books, shows, etc.)
- Social & Community (volunteering, networking, etc.)

This enhancement makes the interests selection much more user-friendly and efficient!
